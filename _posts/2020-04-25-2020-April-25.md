# LeetCode: Jump Game

Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/531/week-4/3310/

Today's problem had couple of edge cases that I did not handle well in the first attempt. 

For instance: 
1. `[0]` - when has only one element. In that case, it is always `true`
2. `[3, 0, 0, 0]` - when the last element is 0. It's `true`

We could naively solve this by iterating through all possible paths. However, the only thing to watch is those zeros in the array. If you can't pass them, you are stuck and the answer is `false`. So the pseudocode: 

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        // In [], we can't reach the 'last index'. So false
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // In [1 or 0], we already reached the end as we start 
        // in the first index. 
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return true;
        }

        // Let's track how far we can reach based on the 
        // numbers we have seen so far
        int maxSoFar = nums[0];

        // Note that this loop returns false when the current i-th is 0,
        // and the maximum jumped location is equal (so we are stuck at i-th)
        // or less (stuck even before i-th). That means that we can't 
        // pass this 'pitfall' of zero. 

        // We only need to iterate from 1 to last second. We skip 
        // the last element because if last element is 0, then 
        // it's not a problem. 
        for (1 <= i <= last second element) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                if (i >= maxSoFar) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, i + nums[i]);
            }
        }

        // If we didn't see any problem with zeros from 1
        // to last second elements, then we are safe!
        return true;
    }
}
```
