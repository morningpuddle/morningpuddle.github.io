# Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal

**Intuition**
How do I construct binary search tree? When I do this by hand, I can see myself doing something like a depth first search. Inserting to left is easy. But, inserting to right requires a check whether the current root I am looking at **has the largest value among the 1) root nodes I have seen so far and 2) the root nodes that have value smaller than the target value**.
```bash
# Given
[8,5,1,7,10,12]

# Create `root` with 8

     8 ← root

# 5 is smaller than the root. So, root.left = 5. root = 5

     8
    /
   5 ← root

# 1 is smaller than the root 5. root.left = 1. root = 1
     8
    /
   5
  /
 1 ← root 

# 7 is larger than current root. Let's think.
# Among the roots I have seen so far (so 1, 5, 8), let's look at the ones smaller than the target 7 (so 1, 5). 
# Then I should insert 7 as the right of root 5. Let's adjust the root to 5.
     8
    /
   5 ← root 
  /
 1 

# Then insert!
     8
    /
   5 ← root 
  / \
 1   7
```

So, here is the psuedo code.
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode bstFromPreorder(int[] preorder) {
        LinkedList<TreeNode> roots = new LinkedList<>();
        List<Integer> arr = preorder; # int[] to List<Integer>
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(arr.get(0));
        arr.remove(0);
        roots.addFirst(root);
        
        while (!arr.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode current = roots.pop();
            int next = arr.get(0);
            if (current.val > next) {
                current.left = new TreeNode(next);
                arr.remove(0);
                roots.addFirst(current);
                roots.addFirst(current.left);
            } else {
                if (amTheLargestRootAmongTheRootsSmallerThanTheTarget(roots, next, current.val)) {
                    current.right = new TreeNode(next);
                    arr.remove(0);
                    roots.addFirst(current);
                    roots.addFirst(current.right);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```
