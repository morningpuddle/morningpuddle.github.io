&nbsp;
# Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/531/week-4/3308/

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        if (m == n) {
            return m;
        }
        
        // if m = 5 = 101, then nearestPower would be 1000
        int nearestPower = power of 2 equal or greater than m;
        for (int i = m + 1; i <= Math.min(nearestPower, n); i++) {
            r &= i;
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
