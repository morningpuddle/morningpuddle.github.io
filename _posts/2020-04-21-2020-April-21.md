# Leftmost column with at least a one

Today's problem, there is a big hint!
> 2. (Optimal Approach) Imagine there is a pointer p(x, y) starting from top right corner. p can only move left or down. If the value at p is 0, move down. If the value at p is 1, move left. Try to figure out the correctness and time complexity of this algorithm.

In other words, we iterate all the 1s left to current (x, y). Once we hit 0, we go to the next row. In the next row, if we have 1 to the left, then we repeat. If not, then move onto the next row, and so on. 


Once the (x, y) is out of boundary, we know that its y represents the 0 (or out of boundary, so might be an imaginary 0) next to the furthest 1. 

Thus, y + 1 or -1 (in the case when y < 0) is the correct answer. 

The runtime would be O(m + n) since every step goes to left or down. In the end, the total number of steps is always m + n.
