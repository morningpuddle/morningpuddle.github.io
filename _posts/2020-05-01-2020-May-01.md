# First Bad Version

**Problem**

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:
```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```

**My Thoughts**

At first, this is a binary search with a few pitfalls.
1. It's 1-index ....ðŸ¤”
2. In each iteration, you need to check two elements to find the first bad version. If the current version i is the first bad version, then `isBadVersion(i) && !isBadVersion(i - 1)` 
3. For 2, there is a special case where `i = 0`. In that case, assuming we are doing binary search correctly and with a guarantee that the problem suggests there *exists* a bad version, we return 0 as the answer.

**Pseudocode**
Let's remind ourselves on the binary search pseudocode.
```java
// Usual Binary Search
int start = 0;
int end = arr.length - 1; // inclusive
while (start <= end) { 
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; 

    if (arr[mid] == x) {
        return mid; 
    }

    if (arr[mid] < x) {
        start = mid + 1; 
    } else {
        end = mid - 1;
    }
}
```

Then we will make following modifications
```java
int start = 0;
int end = n - 1; // inclusive
while (start <= end) { 
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; 

    // (1)
    int oneBasedIndex = mid + 1;
    boolean currentIsBad = isBadVersion(oneBasedIndex);
    // (2)
    boolean prevIsBad = (oneBasedIndex == 1) ? false : isBadVersion(oneBasedIndex - 1);

    // (3)
    if (!prevIsBad && currentIsBad) {
        return oneBasedIndex;
    }

    // (4)
    if (!prevIsBad && !currentIsBad) {
        start = mid + 1;
    // (5)
    } else {
        end = mid - 1;
    }
}
```
1. Since the index is 1-based, we will add 1 to `mid` 
2. When the current index is 1 (or equivalently, `mid` is 0), then we know that it has to be the first bad version. ie. `[bad, bad, bad, bad]`
3. When prev is good and current is bad, then it is the answer!
4. If both prev and current are, then we need to look at the right half. 
5. The else case can be specifically rewritten as `else if (prevIsBad && currentIsBad)`. In that case, we need to look earlier to find the fist bad version. Note that the other case `prevIsBad && !currentIsBad` is not possible by problem design. All versions after a bad version are bad.

Q: Can you also write in recursive way?
