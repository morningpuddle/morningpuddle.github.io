# Ransom Note

A very straightforward problem. 

But there is something I learned. 
```java
// expected
"".split("") = []

// actual
"".split("") = [""]
```
This throw me off for awhile. Beside the [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4964484/why-does-split-on-an-empty-string-return-a-non-empty-array) that confirms the observation, I could not find a good explanation.
