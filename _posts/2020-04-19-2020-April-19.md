# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

This question awfully looks like a binary search in sorted array.
```java
int start = 0;
int end = nums.length - 1;
while (end > start) {
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    if (nums[mid] > target) {           // (1) look at left half
        end = mid;
    } else if (nums[mid] < target) {    // (2) look at right half
        start = mid + 1;
    } else {
        return mid;                     // (3) match!                           
    }

return -1;                              // (4) no match.. :(
```
... until the Leetcode sprinkled the unknown pivot.
The binary search approach above doesn't work in the case when the element is actually in the half not chosen by the algorithm.
```bash
Input: nums = [3, 5, 1], target = 1

# 1st iteration
# start = 0, end = 2
mid = 1
nums[mid] = 5 > target 
end = 1 # following (1) ← in real, it should be right half

# 2nd iteration
# start = 0, end = 1
mid = 0
nums[mind] = 3 > target
end = 0 # following (1)

# 3rd iteration
# start = 0, end = 0
returns -1

```

Here is the train of thoughts: 

**1. Is it possible to find the the real 'start' and 'end' indices in O(log n)?** Then I could do this finding first, and then binary search. However, this seems impossible as it requires O(n) to iterate through to find that pivot point via `nums[i-1] > nums[i] && nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

**2. Then, how could I get the correct start/end indices during the binary search?** Then, we just need to adjust the original binary search to handle the case when the element might be in the other half.

# Pseudo code
```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (end >= start) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                if (when the target is in the right subarray) { //(1)
                    start = mid + 1; // go to right
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                if (when the target is in the left subarray) { //(2)
                    end = mid - 1; // go to left
                } else {
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
For each `when the target is in the (left|right) subarray`, you can do that via comparison of `nums[end]`, `nums[mid]`, `nums[start]` and `target`.

Here is the answer for: (1) `when the target is in the right subarray`. Try (2) on your own.
```
nums[end] <= nums[start] && nums[start] <= nums[mid] && target <= nums[end]
```
